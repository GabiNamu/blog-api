# Blog API
Blog API was a project made for study purpose and it was my first time using Sequelize and JWT(JSON WEB TOKEN).
### In this project I:
- developed an RESTful API and a SQL database to produce content for a blog;
- developed an application in Node.js using the sequelize package to make a CRUD of posts:
  1. To make a post, you need a user and a login, so the relationship between user and post will be worked on, and I used JWT for user authentication;
  2. It will be necessary to use categories for posts, thus working on the relationship of posts to categories and categories to posts;
  
### Main technologies:
- Docker;
- JavaScript;
- Node.js;
- Express;
- MySql.
- Sequelize;
- JWT;
